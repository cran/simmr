\title{
Function to load in simmr data and check for errors
}
\description{
This function takes in the mixture data, food source means and standard deviations, and (optionally) correction factor means and standard deviations, and concentraion proportions. It performs some (non-exhaustive) checking of the data to make sure it will run through simmr. It outputs an object of class \code{simmr_input}.
}
\usage{
simmr_load(mixtures, 
source_names, 
source_means, 
source_sds, 
correction_means = NULL, 
correction_sds = NULL, 
concentration_means = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{mixtures}{
The mixture data given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of observations and the number of columns is the number of tracers (usually isotopes)
}
  \item{source_names}{
The names of the sources given as a character string
}
  \item{source_means}{
The means of the source values, given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of sources and the number of columns is the number of tracers
}
  \item{source_sds}{
The standard deviations of the source values, given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of sources and the number of columns is the number of tracers
}
  \item{correction_means}{
The means of the correction values, given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of sources and the number of columns is the number of tracers. If not provided these are set to 0.
}
  \item{correction_sds}{
The standard deviations of the correction values, given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of sources and the number of columns is the number of tracers. If not provided these are set to 0.
}
  \item{concentration_means}{
The means of the concentration values, given as a matrix where the number of rows is the number of sources and the number of columns is the number of tracers. These should be between 0 and 1. If not provided these are all set to 1.
}
}
\details{
For standard stable isotope mixture modelling, the mixture matrix will contain a row for each individual and a column for each isotopic value. \code{simmr} will allow for any number of isotopes and any number of observations, within computational limits. The source means/sds should be provided for each food source on each isotope. The correction means (usually trophic enrichment factors) can be set as zero if required, and should be of the same shape as the source values. The concentration dependence means should be estimated values of the proportion of each element in the food source in question and should be given in proportion format between 0 and 1. At present there is no means to include concentration standard deviations.
